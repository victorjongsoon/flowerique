## 2 - Sign Up Page
This is the Sign Up page for the website. In order for a user to make purchases at Flowerique, he needs to create an account with Flowerique first.

## 3 - Login Page
This is the login page for Flowerique. A user has to login with an existing account in order to place an order. 
If a user does not have an existing account, the user has to create an account via the sign up link in the navigation bar 
in order to place an order. When a user forgets his password, he can click on the forget password link to retrieve his password.

## 4 - Forget Password Page
This is the forget password page for Flowerique. When a user is not able to login because he forgets his password, he can choose to retrieve his password from the forget password page. To retrieve his password back, the user has to first key in his email address. The email address must be one that is registered in the database. If the email address does not exist in the database, the user cannot proceed to the second phase and will be redirected to an error page.

The second phase requires the user to key in the correct answer to the security question. This security question and answer to the security question is what the user keyed in during the registration process. If the answer to the security question is wrong, the user will be redirected to an error page.
